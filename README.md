# DS_F1ght_TEAM

Updates 06.11:
At the moment we are at the research stage for the best approches for recsys (chech clusterization folder), so we do not provide train-test splits. 
For the DE part, we worked on adding FastApi (before that and at the moment we have a telegram bot)
All gelstalts that we did not close for the 3rd sprint we will close by 16.11.
